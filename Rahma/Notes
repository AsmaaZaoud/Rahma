3. npx expo install react-native-async-storage/async-storage@1.18.2

Below is the warning I got when I ran the application so I updated the async storage version as suggested in the warning:
 
Some dependencies are incompatible with the installed expo version:
@react-native-async-storage/async-storage@1.23.1 - expected version: 1.18.2
Your project may not work correctly until you install the correct versions of the packages.
Fix with: npx expo install --fix
