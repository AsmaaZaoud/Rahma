1.3. npx expo install react-native-async-storage/async-storage@1.18.2

Below is the warning I got when I ran the application so I updated the async storage version as suggested in the warning:
 
Some dependencies are incompatible with the installed expo version:
@react-native-async-storage/async-storage@1.23.1 - expected version: 1.18.2
Your project may not work correctly until you install the correct versions of the packages.
Fix with: npx expo install --fix

WARNING

WARN  [2024-05-01T09:02:12.838Z]  @firebase/auth: Auth (10.11.1):
You are initializing Firebase Auth for React Native without providing
AsyncStorage. Auth state will default to memory persistence and will not
persist between sessions. In order to persist auth state, install the package
"@react-native-async-storage/async-storage" and provide it to
initializeAuth:

import { initializeAuth, getReactNativePersistence } from 'firebase/auth';
import ReactNativeAsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';
const auth = initializeAuth(app, {
  persistence: getReactNativePersistence(ReactNativeAsyncStorage)
});

3.2. npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
